# Creating an API with Express.js

> **Warning**
>  
> Express.js is a web application framework used to build server applications for Node.js. As such, and since there are various versions (sometimes incompatible) of Node.js around, we highly encourage for you to install Node Version Manager (nvm) before proceeding with this tutorial.
>
> Instructions to install nvm can be found on their GitHub repository: [https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Notice that, since we are using nvm , there is a `.nvmrc` file at the root of this repository, which defines the  version of Node that we will be using for this project.
>
> You might need to run `nvm install lts/gallium`.
